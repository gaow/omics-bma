## A complete toy analysis example

This example uses a very light-weight input data-set to run all analysis steps involved. This is not a unit-test (it does not check for correctness of the runs), rather it is a play-ground to evaluate the interface. To run the test,
```
./interface.sos
```
To run simulation of toy data,
```
./interface.sos simulation
```
To run eqtlbma analysis as a benchmark,
```
./interface.sos eqtlbma
```
