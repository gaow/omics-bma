#! Documentation
###
# Executing command @@snakemake all@@ under this directory deploys documentation for each folder in this repository (the @@README.md@@ file), as well the entire [OmicsBMA Wiki|@http://bioinformatics.org/bma@]. @@README.md@@ documents thus generated are the same material as on the [user manual|@http://bioinformatics.org/bma/manual/start@] and [developer's info|@http://bioinformatics.org/bma/development/start@] Wiki pages, only that the Wiki is better organized and easier to browse.
# ""Files in this directory are the only source files to build the entire documentation"". All contributions to documentation should go into this directory using syntax of @@*.notes@@ file, along with appropriate edits to the @@Snakemake@@ file.
# File name convention under this centralized directory is as follows:
#{list
# For file @@/path/to/file/*.notes@@ the file name will be @@path-to-file-*.notes@@
# All pathes are relative to @@src@@ unless otherwise specified, e.g. @@doc.notes@@ and @@home.notes@@
# A special type of doc @@sidebar-*.notes@@ is the navigation page for the OmicBMA wiki site. @@*@@ here denotes wiki page namespace, for example @@sidebar-development.notes@@ is the navigation bar for @http://bioinformatics.org/bma/development/start@
